## Description

1. Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
  * In this competition, I used many traditional classifiers (e.g. logistic reg, linear svc, svm, naive bayes, knn, perceptron, decision tree, random forest, ...) 
2. Forest Cover Type Prediction
  * In this competition, the outcome is not binary and it is multi-class. 
3. Mercari Price Suggestion


I would recommend all of the knowledge and getting started competitions. There's rich discussion on forums, and the datasets are clean, small, and well-behaved.

Specifically, I would recommend the following in order:

Regression with temporal component: Bike Sharing Demand
Binary Classification with text data: Random Acts of Pizza


There is a Getting Started Category in the Kaggle competition page.
